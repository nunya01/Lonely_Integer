# Lonely_Integer
A puzzle from HR
This is a question from HR that drove me nuts. It seemed so simple, but the for whatever reason I couldn't get it. I knew there had to be an "easy" way, but I didn't want to cheat. 
I kludged through and this is what I came up with. It does work and passes all the test cases.
If you want to know what they were REALLY looking for, look up XOR. They wanted you to construct a logical XOR operation for C++.
